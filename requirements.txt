mcp[cli]
pydantic
# The mcp library might require additional dependencies for specific transports like streamable-http (e.g., uvicorn, fastapi).
# If `pip install mcp` doesn't pull them, they might need to be added explicitly or by installing extras like `mcp[cli]` or `mcp[server]`
# For example, you might need:
uvicorn
fastapi
